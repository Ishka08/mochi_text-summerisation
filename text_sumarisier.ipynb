            "At its core, market segmentation is the practice of dividing your target market into approachable groups. Market segmentation creates subsets of a market based on demographics, needs, priorities, common interests and other psychographic or behavioral criteria used to better understand the target audience (\"Market Segmentation - Qualtrics\" 2022). Market segmentation allows you to target your content to the right people in the right way, rather than targeting your entire audience with a generic message. This helps you increase the chances of people engaging with your ad or content, resulting in more efficient campaigns and improved return on investment (\"Market Segmentation- Lotame\" 2019).  Market segmentation helps a business to comprehend consumer behaviors and this aid in building good relationships between the customers and the business. Segmentation is divided and identified as five bases namely: Geography, Demographics, Psychographics, Benefit sought and Usage rate. This report will examine three segmentation bases used by Pringles, a flavored chip which most people adore.\n"
